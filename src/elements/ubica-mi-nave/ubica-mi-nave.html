      Car GPS position software. Using geolocalization API,
      it saved your car’s last location and showed you a
      picture of it using Augmented Realty.
      This project was conceived during a SuperHappyDevHouse event.
      We decided to continue the development after the event and we formed a
      small team, a designer, a product manager and me as a developer.
