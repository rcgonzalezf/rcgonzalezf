      This workshop was covering topics for
      Android developers from basic to intermediate level,
      the duration of this workshop was two weeks
      including 2 classes, labs and support via internet.
      I designed the workshop, the materials and the labs.

      I decided to create a project template for Android newbies,
      basically the goal of this was to create some Instant Messaging apps
      like Telegram or WhatsApp (not popular or unexistant in that time).
      I based my idea on the Blackberry IM service.
      With this template I was able to start teaching people in Android.

      You can see the base code, that I no longer mantain here:
