      This is a list of dreams.  You state your dream and it is set as a goal.
      You can share your dream, and split it into steps in order to achieve your goal.
       The app records your voice and, using Google Voice API,
       it sends what you dream of the API.
       The API answers with some services or suggestions
       to help you make your dream come true.
